# Stock-Analysis
# Purpose
The purpose of the assignment was to write VBA code to show the total daily volume and total return for a company's ticker code for the years 2017 and 2018. This analysis could ultimatley be the difference whether to invest in a company or not.
# Results
## Ticker Perfomances
It appears as most companies performed the much worse from 2017 to 2018. Only RUN made a large increase in return from 5.5% to 84%. ENPH was still positive but a major drop of from 2017

## Runtime
the runtime of the code was under 1  second for each year. the original code took a full second plus to run through all the ticker data.
# Summary
the Advantages of the refactored code is that it can be run much faster, even if that saved time is only half a second, over time that could add up to entire day of running a report. The disadvantages is the code is much longer and complex then the first code that it would take many hours to refactor the original code that was shown to work.
